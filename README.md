2. CSS
3. React JS
4. Material UI Icons
5. Redux Toolkit, Rdeux Thunk(for fetching api data)

## Features Of Todo-App
- **User Authentication:** I have not used backend, but used local storage for storing user authentication status.User will not access todos page without signing in.After sining up user will be redirected to todos page and also can logout by one click.
- **Add Task:** Users should be able to input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button.
- **Completed Tasks Chart:** Percentage of tasks done will be shown in form of chart.
- **View Tasks:** All tasks will be displayed in priority wise after they are added.
- **Priority Wise Tasks View:** All tasks will be diplayed priority wise high, medium and low.
- **Delete Task:** Each task should have a delete button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.
- **Delete All Tasks:** By clicking all tasks will be deletd from local storage and list will be empty.
- **Persistent Storage:** Used local storage  to save tasks and authentication status, ensuring data persistence across browser sessions.
- **Mark As Done:** When user clicks on box or text task is lined through and box is checked representing task is done.
- **Mark As Done All:** By clicking on this button all tasks will be marked as done and will be diplayed separately from undone tasks.
- **Api Integration:** I have integrated the weather api using redux thunk for fetching data of weather.
- **Weather Info:** I have build a weather componet in which user can check the weather of any city it will help if user have any outdoor activity.
- **State Management:** I also used redux toolkit for centralized state management and redux thunk for fetching api data like weather data of cties.
